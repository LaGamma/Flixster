### Notes

It was challenging to get the Heterogeneous RecyclerView Adapter to properly employ data binding on the two separate xml layouts, since I only used one ViewHolder that assigned the same layout elements in both of them. I ultimately had to have two separate binding variables for each xml layout although this is not ideal because it results in some duplicate code.

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
- [x] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [x] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [x] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [x] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
Android Studio target API level 30 would give a runtime error on startup, but changing to API level 28 worked fine. Renaming a project in Android Studio is a bit of a hassle but the solution I found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18276872/change-project-name-on-android-studio).
